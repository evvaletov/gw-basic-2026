# Roadmap

## The Big One

- **GW-BASIC 2026 Compiler** — ahead-of-time compilation of BASIC programs to
  native executables.  Because nothing says "premature optimization" like
  compiling a language designed for an interpreter running on a 4.77 MHz 8088.
  But we've come this far, so why not?  Likely approach: translate the token
  stream to C and lean on GCC/Clang for the heavy lifting.

## Completed

### Hardware I/O Simulator (v0.15.0)

Implemented in `portio.c` / `portio.h` following the `virmem.c` dispatch
pattern.  Emulates 8253 PIT channel 2 (speaker frequency), PPI port B
(speaker on/off with continuous tone via PulseAudio), CGA mode/color
registers, game port (joystick stub), and COM1 serial (transmitter-ready
stub).  Default: reads return 0xFF (floating bus), writes discarded.

Statements: `OUT`, `WAIT`, `MOTOR`.  Functions: `INP()`, `STICK()`, `STRIG()`.

## Next Up

*(Looking for the next major feature — see IDE and Notebook Integration below.)*

## IDE and Notebook Integration

- **Jupyter kernel for GW-BASIC** — a Jupyter Notebook kernel that runs
  GW-BASIC programs cell-by-cell, with rich output for `PRINT`, inline graphics
  rendering for drawing commands, and interactive `INPUT` via notebook widgets.
  Similar in spirit to [foxkernel](https://github.com/evvaletov/foxkernel).
- **JetBrains plugin (IntelliJ/CLion)** — full-featured language plugin with
  syntax highlighting, code completion, line number navigation, run
  configurations, debugger integration (breakpoints via `STOP`, variable
  inspection), structure view (line number outline), and error annotations.
- **VS Code extension** — language extension providing syntax highlighting
  (TextMate grammar), snippets, run/debug tasks, integrated terminal runner,
  and Language Server Protocol support for diagnostics and hover info.

## Known Limitations

- String garbage collection not implemented (uses `malloc`/`free` instead)
- Maximum 256 variables, 64 arrays, 16 FOR nesting, 24 GOSUB nesting,
  16 WHILE nesting
